## Purpose

The purpose of the editor is to quickly get you started making a manifest file, as well as making life easier by:

* Explain the fields you need to define
* Automatically updating version numbers
* Providing select options where applicable
* Auto-complete available integration scopes
* Make it easy to find appropriate device xAPIs

There is also a raw JSON editor, in case there are options that the editor has overlooked.
