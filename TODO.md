# Manifest editor

- Link to sample manifests (when available)
- More validation
  - Report if required fields are empty
  - Check that scopes are set if xStatus and xCommands are defined
  - And the opposite (otherwise control hub complains if you need a xStatus scope without any apis defined)
- Add support for popper.js and add tips here and there
- Button for creating new uuid
